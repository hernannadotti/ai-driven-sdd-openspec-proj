# AI-Driven Spec Driven Development - OpenSpec Project

## 🤖 100% AI-Driven Development

This project is **entirely AI-driven**, demonstrating the power and potential of artificial intelligence in modern software development. Every aspect of this project, from conception to implementation, is guided by AI assistance.

## 📱 Purpose

This repository showcases how to build a **React Native application** using the **Spec Driven Development (SDD)** process. The project serves as a practical example and testing ground for AI-assisted development workflows.

## 🎯 What is Spec Driven Development?

Spec Driven Development (SDD) is a methodology where:
- Development begins with clear, well-defined specifications
- The specification serves as the single source of truth
- Implementation follows directly from the spec
- Changes to functionality start with updates to the specification

This approach ensures consistency, clarity, and maintainability throughout the development lifecycle.

## 🔧 OpenSpec SDD Framework

This project specifically tests and validates the **openSpec SDD framework**, exploring:
- How specifications drive the development process
- Integration with React Native mobile app development
- AI-assisted code generation from specifications
- Best practices for spec-first development

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- **100% AI-Driven**: All development decisions and implementations are AI-generated
- **React Native**: Mobile app development using modern cross-platform technology
- **Specification-First**: Following strict SDD principles
- **Framework Testing**: Practical validation of the openSpec SDD framework

## 📝 About

This is an experimental and educational project demonstrating the intersection of:
